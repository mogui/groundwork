# groundwork-verify

Generates Cucumber.js step definitions that test the system as a black box through its external interface.
Step definitions live in `docs/specs` — a self-contained layer with its own `package.json`, independent of the project's stack.

## CONSTRAINT — Epistemic perimeter

```
This skill NEVER reads files outside docs/specs/.
No access to src/, app/, lib/, or any application directory.
If information is missing, ASK the user — never infer it from code.
```

This is non-negotiable. The skill must have exactly the same information as the Gherkin — no more, no less.
Reading application code introduces cognitive bias: the skill learns patterns from the implementation (including bugs) and replicates them in step definitions. Tests end up validating the implementation instead of the contract.

**The constraint prevents the bias vector** — it doesn't matter if the dev knows the code. What matters is that the skill doesn't use it as source of truth.

**Clarification:** Information provided verbally by the dev (e.g. "the endpoint changed to POST /refunds") is legitimate input. You MAY update `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` with information the dev tells you directly — the constraint forbids reading application files, not listening to the dev. The interview mechanism works the same way: the dev describes the interface, you write it down.

## When to use

- After implementation completes a feature and you need to verify it matches the spec
- User asks to generate tests from `.feature` files
- User asks "does the code do what we specified?"
- New scenarios were added via `/groundwork extend` and step definitions need updating

## When NOT to use

- User wants to define or design a feature → use groundwork-discovery
- User wants unit tests or internal code tests — this skill is black-box only
- No `.feature` files exist yet

## Quick reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/groundwork verify <feature>` | Generate/update step definitions for one feature |
| `/groundwork verify` | Generate/update step definitions for all features |

| Interface type | Tooling | Assertions via |
|---|---|---|
| `rest` / `rest+web` | `node-fetch` | HTTP status, JSON body |
| `cli` | `child_process.exec` | stdout, stderr, exit code |
| `web` / `rest+web` | Playwright | Page elements, navigation |

## First action

Read `docs/specs/CONVENTIONS.md` if it exists.
Then read existing step definitions in `docs/specs/step-definitions/` to understand the style already in use.

**Do NOT read any file outside `docs/specs/`.**

---

## SPEC-INTERFACE.md — Interface contract

`SPEC-INTERFACE.md` lives in `docs/specs/` and is the **only** source from which this skill gets information about the system under test.

It is written by the dev, not inferred from code. This is the critical point: describing the system explicitly breaks implicit bias — the dev reasons about the contract, not the implementation.

### Structure

```markdown
# Interface Contract

## Type
rest | web | rest+web | cli

## Base URLs
api: http://localhost:3000/api/v1
web: http://localhost:5173

## Auth
type: bearer | cookie | none
token_env: TEST_AUTH_TOKEN        # env var name, not the value

## Endpoint map
# Format: METHOD /path → expected response (success | error)
POST /auth/login         → 200 {token} | 401
GET  /users/:id          → 200 {user} | 404
POST /orders             → 201 {order} | 422

## Web entry points
# Format: <feature> → <path>
login     → /login
dashboard → /dashboard
checkout  → /checkout

## Notes
# Any contextual information useful for tests, not inferable from scenarios
```

The **Endpoint map** section is the most important: it explicitly maps scenarios → interface, forcing the dev to declare the contract instead of letting the skill deduce it from code.

---

## Architecture

### Prerequisite

The system under test exposes a standard external interface. Step definitions never touch internal code — they interact exclusively through:

- **REST/GraphQL** — endpoints
- **CLI** — command-line process
- **Web** — browser UI

### Fixed toolchain

Cucumber.js for all cases. Playwright added if any feature uses the `web` interface type.

```
docs/
  specs/
    package.json              ← cucumber.js (+ playwright if needed)
    cucumber.js               ← cucumber config
    CONVENTIONS.md
    SPEC-INTERFACE.md         ← interface contract (only source of system info)
    features/
      <domain>/<feature>.feature
    step-definitions/
      <domain>/<feature>.steps.js
    support/
      hooks.js                ← Before/After setup and teardown
      world.js                ← shared state across steps
    .env.test.example         ← required env vars, no secrets
```

### Interface → tooling map

| Interface type | HTTP client | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rest` | `node-fetch` | JSON request/response assertions |
| `cli` | `child_process.exec` | spawn process, assert stdout/exit code |
| `web` | Playwright | headless browser, behavioural assertions |

A single feature can mix `rest` and `web` steps if the interface type is `rest+web`.

## Command

### `/groundwork verify [feature-name]`

Generate or update step definitions. Without argument, processes all `.feature` files.

---

### Phase 1 — Interface discovery

```
SPEC-INTERFACE.md exists?
├── YES → read the file
│         ↓
│    all necessary information present?
│    ├── YES → proceed to Phase 2
│    └── NO → ask only the missing gaps, update the file
│
└── NO → enter interview mode
          generate SPEC-INTERFACE.md at the end
          proceed to Phase 2
```

#### Interview (only if the file doesn't exist or is incomplete)

Ask questions in order, one at a time:

1. *"Interface type: REST API, Web UI, or both?"*
2. *"Base URL of the system in test environment?"*
3. *"How does it authenticate? Bearer token, session cookie, or none?"*
4. *"For each scenario in the `.feature`, which endpoint or page is involved?"*

Question 4 is the core anti-bias mechanism: the dev manually maps scenarios → interface, without the skill looking at code.

#### Incremental update

If `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` exists but has gaps (e.g. a new scenario references an unmapped endpoint):

- Ask only for the missing information
- Update the file with append, without touching existing sections
- Explicitly report what was added

---

### Phase 2 — Gap analysis

Compare `.feature` files against existing step definitions in `docs/specs/step-definitions/`:

| Status | Action |
|---|---|
| **Missing** — scenario with no step definition | Generate |
| **Broken** — step definition referencing a changed endpoint or selector | Regenerate |
| **Obsolete** — step definition with no matching scenario | Report to user, do not delete |

Only generate what is missing or broken. Never rewrite working step definitions.

Report the gap analysis before generating:
```
Found 3 scenarios without step definitions:
  - auth/login.feature: "login with expired token"
  - payments/checkout.feature: "checkout with empty cart" (new)
  - payments/checkout.feature: "duplicate order submission" (new)
Generating...
```

---

### Phase 3 — Generate step definitions

Use information from `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` (base URLs, endpoints, auth type) to generate step definitions. **Never look at application code to determine URLs, selectors, or configuration.**

**REST pattern:**
```javascript
// Scenario: <scenario name from .feature>
Given('a registered user exists with email {string}', async function(email) {
  // TODO: adjust to your seed/fixture mechanism
  this.user = await createTestUser({ email });
});

When('they attempt login with incorrect credentials', async function() {
  // URL from SPEC-INTERFACE.md endpoint map
  this.response = await fetch(`${process.env.BASE_URL}/auth/login`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ email: this.user.email, password: 'wrong' })
  });
});

Then('the operation fails with an authentication error', async function() {
  assert.strictEqual(this.response.status, 401);
});
```

**Web pattern:**
```javascript
// Scenario: <scenario name from .feature>
Given('a registered user exists', async function() {
  // TODO: adjust to your seed/fixture mechanism
  this.user = await createTestUser();
});

When('they attempt login with incorrect credentials', async function() {
  // Path from SPEC-INTERFACE.md web entry points
  await this.page.goto(`${process.env.WEB_URL}/login`);
  await this.page.fill('[data-testid="login-email"]', this.user.email);
  await this.page.fill('[data-testid="login-password"]', 'wrong');
  await this.page.click('[data-testid="login-submit"]');
});

Then('the operation fails with an authentication error', async function() {
  await expect(this.page.locator('[data-testid="login-error"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Selector naming convention:** Use `data-testid="<page>-<element>"` (e.g. `login-email`, `checkout-submit`). Choose names that describe the UI concept from the scenario, not the implementation. These selectors are declared in the step definitions first — the dev adds them to the markup after.

**CLI pattern:**
```javascript
// Scenario: <scenario name from .feature>
When('they run the export command', async function() {
  this.cliOutput = await exec(`node cli.js export --user=${this.user.id}`);
});

Then('the export succeeds', async function() {
  assert.strictEqual(this.cliOutput.exitCode, 0);
});
```

**Rules for all patterns:**
- Add `// Scenario: <name>` comment at the top referencing the `.feature` origin
- Use URLs and paths from `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` — comment the source (e.g. `// URL from SPEC-INTERFACE.md endpoint map`)
- Mark with `// TODO:` anything requiring manual configuration (seed mechanisms, selectors)
- For `@pending` scenarios, generate a stub with `pending()` — do not skip silently
- For `@out-of-scope` scenarios, generate nothing

---

### Phase 4 — Setup (first run only)

If `docs/specs/package.json` does not exist:

1. Generate `docs/specs/package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "specs",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cucumber-js",
    "test:tag": "cucumber-js --tags"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@cucumber/cucumber": "^10.0.0",
    "node-fetch": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```
Add `"@playwright/test": "^1.0.0"` and `"playwright": "^1.0.0"` if any `web` interface type exists.

2. Generate `docs/specs/cucumber.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: {
    paths: ['features/**/*.feature'],
    require: ['step-definitions/**/*.steps.js', 'support/**/*.js'],
    format: ['progress-bar', 'html:reports/cucumber-report.html'],
    parallel: 2
  }
}
```

3. Generate `docs/specs/support/world.js` with shared state (page instance for Playwright, auth tokens, last response)

4. Generate `docs/specs/support/hooks.js` with `Before` / `After` lifecycle hooks for setup and teardown

5. Generate `docs/specs/.env.test.example` based on `SPEC-INTERFACE.md`:
```
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Add other required env vars from SPEC-INTERFACE.md here
```

6. Add to the project root `package.json` (if it exists):
```json
"test:bdd": "cd docs/specs && npm test"
```

7. Add `docs/specs/.env.test` to `.gitignore`

---

## Drift handling

`SPEC-INTERFACE.md` can become stale if the API changes without updating the file. The skill cannot detect this automatically — that would require reading application code, violating the constraint.

**Mitigation strategy:** CI failure is the drift signal.

```
CI red for 404 / element not found
   → dev updates SPEC-INTERFACE.md
   → /groundwork verify <feature>   (regenerates step definitions)
   → CI green
```

Drift is detected at runtime, not compile time. This is an acceptable trade-off: the cost of a false negative in CI is much lower than the cost of tests that validate bugs.

---

## Output summary

After generation, always report:

```
Generated:
  docs/specs/step-definitions/auth/login.steps.js        (3 scenarios)
  docs/specs/step-definitions/payments/checkout.steps.js  (2 scenarios)

Stubs (pending):
  docs/specs/step-definitions/auth/login.steps.js        → "login with biometric" (@pending)

Skipped:
  payments/checkout.feature → "guest checkout" (@out-of-scope)

Obsolete (no matching scenario — not deleted):
  docs/specs/step-definitions/auth/register.steps.js     → "register with invite code"

Next steps:
  1. Copy docs/specs/.env.test.example → docs/specs/.env.test and fill in values
  2. Review // TODO: comments in generated files
  3. Add the required selectors (see prompt below)
  4. cd docs/specs && npm install && npm test
```

### Selector prompt (only for `web` / `rest+web` features)

After the output summary, if any step definition uses Playwright selectors, generate a **ready-to-copy prompt** listing every `data-testid` the step definitions expect. The dev pastes this prompt into their coding agent to add the selectors to the markup.

Format:

```
---
The following data-testid attributes are required by the BDD step definitions.
Add them to the corresponding UI elements in the application code.

Page: /login
  - data-testid="login-email"       → email input field
  - data-testid="login-password"    → password input field
  - data-testid="login-submit"      → submit button
  - data-testid="login-error"       → error message container (visible on auth failure)

Page: /checkout
  - data-testid="checkout-card"     → credit card input
  - data-testid="checkout-submit"   → place order button
  - data-testid="checkout-success"  → order confirmation message
---
```

**Rules for the selector prompt:**
- Group by page (from `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` web entry points)
- Each line: the exact `data-testid` value + a short description of the expected element
- Include selectors for assertions too (error messages, success states, content checks)
- Only list selectors that appear in the generated step definitions — no extras

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Reading application code (src/, app/, lib/) to determine URLs or config | **NEVER.** Use only `SPEC-INTERFACE.md`. If info is missing, ask the user. |
| Rewriting working step definitions | Always run gap analysis first — only generate what is missing or broken |
| Assuming the interface type without checking `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` | Read the file or ask the user — never infer from code |
| Importing or calling internal project code in step definitions | Step definitions are black-box — interact only through the external interface |
| Skipping `@pending` scenarios silently | Generate a stub with `pending()` so they show up in test reports |
| Deleting obsolete step definitions without asking | Report obsolete definitions to the user — never delete automatically |
| Forgetting `// TODO:` markers on config-dependent code | Mark seed mechanisms, selectors, and URLs that need manual adjustment |
| Inferring endpoints from code when `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` has gaps | Ask the user to update `SPEC-INTERFACE.md` — never fill gaps from code |
